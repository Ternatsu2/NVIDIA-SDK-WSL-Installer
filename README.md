# NVIDIA SDK WSL Installer

Automates the installation and configuration of:
- **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**
- **Ubuntu (22.04 or 24.04)**
- **NVIDIA SDK Manager**

This **executable** streamlines the entire setup process for developers and engineers using NVIDIA tools and WSL on Windows. 

---

## What It Does

1. Checks if WSL is installed and, if not, enables and installs it.
2. Installs Ubuntu 22.04.
3. Installs required dependencies (including Google Chrome in WSL).
4. Installs the NVIDIA SDK Manager from your provided `.deb` file.

---

## Requirements

1. **Windows 10 (2004+) or Windows 11** with WSL support.
2. **Administrator Privileges** to run the installer.
3. **NVIDIA SDK Manager `.deb` File**  
   - Download the `.deb` package from [NVIDIA Developer](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-sdk-manager)  
   - Place it in your `C:\Users\<YourUser>\Downloads` folder.

---

## Usage

1. **Download** the `InstallWSL_Automated.exe`.
2. **Right-click** on `InstallWSL_Automated.exe` → **Run as Administrator**.

That’s it. The script automatically performs all tasks behind the scenes. Once it finishes, you can open WSL and verify that Ubuntu is set up and the NVIDIA SDK Manager is installed.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **“File Not Found”**:  
  Make sure the `.deb` file is in your Downloads folder.  
- **Missing WSL**:  
  The installer will enable it if needed, but ensure your Windows version supports it.  
- **Administrator Privileges**:  
  If the installer won’t run, verify you’re running it as admin. Right-click → **Run as Administrator**.
