# NVIDIA SDK WSL Installer

Automates the installation and configuration of:
- **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**
- **Ubuntu 22.04 (Makes a custom distribution so you don't have to worry about overwriting your files)**
- **NVIDIA SDK Manager**

This **executable** streamlines the entire setup process for developers and engineers using NVIDIA tools and WSL on Windows.

## What It Does

1. Checks if WSL is installed and, if not, enables and installs it.
2. Installs Ubuntu 22.04.
3. Installs required dependencies (including Google Chrome in WSL).
4. Installs the NVIDIA SDK Manager from your provided `.deb` file.

To ensure the user has everything they need to successfully run your script, here’s a checklist of requirements:

---

#### **Prerequisites**
Before running the script, ensure you have the following:
1. **Ubuntu 22.04 Tarball**
   - Download it from this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pZXml5XwobZBa3Mft7ejphfUNqWAy81K/view?usp=drive_link
   - Place it in your `Downloads` folder.
2. **NVIDIA SDK Manager `.deb` File**
   - Download it from: https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-sdk-manager
   - Place it in your `Downloads` folder.
3. **Administrator Privileges**
   - Run the script as an administrator.
4. **Windows System**
   - Ensure WSL2 is supported (Windows 10 2004+ or Windows 11).
5. **Google Chrome**
   - The script will install Chrome if it’s not already installed.
6. **Disk Space**
   - Ensure at least 10 GB of free disk space is available.

## Usage (After you meet the prerequisites)

1. **Download** the `InstallWSL_Automated.exe`.
2. **Right-click** on `InstallWSL_Automated.exe` → **Run as Administrator**.

That’s it. The script automatically performs all tasks behind the scenes. Once it finishes, you can open WSL and verify that Ubuntu is set up and the NVIDIA SDK Manager is installed.
For detailed guidance on using NVIDIA SDK Manager, visit NVIDIA's official SDK Manager documentation. https://developer.nvidia.com/sdk-manager

## Troubleshooting

- **“File Not Found”**:  
  Make sure the `.deb` and `.tar` files are in your Downloads folder.  
- **Missing WSL**:  
  The installer will enable it if needed, but ensure your Windows version supports it.  
- **Administrator Privileges**:  
  If the installer won’t run, verify you’re running it as admin. Right-click → **Run as Administrator**.
